                    As a frequent traveller you get to update your travelling experiences and as well learn the travelling habits of others. As a newbie you get to know the travellers and places they have already travelled and a lot of details about their trips which you
                    can use to plan your travel. It is as if you are living someone's journey and you know what mistakes you should not repeat :-) !.
